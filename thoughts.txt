Some thoughts
---

1. Is there a way to utilize Bayesian optimization (for example in determining the weights
for RPI'ing)? or when we fill out the entries (e.g, the best way to fill out the bracket)

2. Player stats as features -- compute the advanced statistics for the players as well

3. Human prediction seemed to be doing the best -- for each matchup, we will need to 
use the machine predictor but also to look at each game and make judgement on the games
as well (this is possible for Buffet challenge but not for Kaggle)

4. On ranking: learning to rank? DPP?

5. Prob matrix factorization

6. PageRank?

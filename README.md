Overview
--------
Objective: To create an algorithm which assigns a probability of winning to two teams that are matched up, based on any available data from NCAA Div I Men's Basketball.

### Ideas:
...
Test

1. Cluster the teams to several groups. So when A play B, the teams that belong to the same group as B can be used as tranning data, so does for team A.

### Methods:
...
